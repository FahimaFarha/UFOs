# UFOs

## Challenge Overview 
We had to create a webpage that would filter through UFO sightings and display it in a table.

## Resources Used
- javascript data store with all the UFO sightings
- JavaScript, VS Code, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, D3

## Challenge Summary
We were able to create a HTML page that displayed the data regarding UFO sightings in a concise table. We were asked to create an event that would allow a user to filter through five options: date, city, state, country, and shape.

For the Challenge, we were asked to implement three or more Bootstrap elements in our HTML webpage. I was able to change the color of the text in the wrapper, body and jumbotron. In addition, I was able to change the font of the jumbotron to bold. Finally, I added a calendar icon to the date filter of the table. These modifications can be seen in the screenshot below.

A few things that could be improved upon for the webpage include a function that could autopopulate the filters. For example, unless you know that specific shapes of the UFO sightings, it would be difficult to just filter through shapes. This would be especially helpful with the date filter. When entering an arbitrary date, to see if the filter was functioning, I came across a date that held no data (see image below).

If there were a way to make the calendar icon pop up and allow a user to select a specific date, it might make for a nicer user experience.
